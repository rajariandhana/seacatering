## About The Stack
The frontend uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a [React](https://react.dev) framework which allows easy routing by just using the structure of the project. [NextUI/HeroUI](https://www.heroui.com/) provides reusable components used with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) as a CSS framework. For authentication and sessions [next-auth]() and [JWT]() is used.
